# Super-Mario-Game

Super Mario Rogue-Like Game

## Description

This project is a Java console-based rogue-like game with the theme of Super Mario. It was developed using Object-Oriented Design principles and completed during the 2021 Semester 1 for the FIT2099 Object-Oriented Design and Implementation Assignments. The game engine code (`game/engine`) is credited to the Monash University FIT2099 Teaching Team.

The game implements various features and mechanics inspired by the Super Mario series, providing an engaging and interactive gaming experience. It incorporates Object-Oriented Design concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to achieve a modular and extensible codebase.

In addition to the game itself, the repository includes a comprehensive documentation package. The documentation package consists of UML diagrams, design justifications, and reports, providing insights into the design decisions and overall architecture of the game.

By exploring the documentation, you can gain a deeper understanding of the project's design rationale and implementation details.
